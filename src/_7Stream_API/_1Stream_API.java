        /** stream -- for example stream means flow of water so if you sitting near
         river we cannot touch the same water after it moves.

         likewise in stream we
         can use stream only once. we cannot reuse it.

         for example we cannot print stream elements more than once

         Stream s1 = a1.stream();
         s1.forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));
         s1.forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));  //we cannot use like this


         benefit of stream is that has lot of methods so that we can perform some operations
         methods like filter, map, reduce
         **/
    }
}
